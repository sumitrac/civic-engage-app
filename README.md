# civic_engage_app_frontend

## One-Time Project Setup
- Follow these directions once at the beginning of your project:
- Fork the project repo to your own GitHub account


## Navigate to your (projects_folder) in your local machine 
- $ cd ~project_folder
- Clone the project into your projects folder. 
- This command makes a new folder called civic_enage_app_frontend, and then puts the project into this new folder:

- $ git clone ... 

- Use ls to confirm there's a new project folder
- Move your location into this project folder as you wish
  - $ cd Civic_enage_web_app
  
Install the dependencies that are already determined and defined for us.
- $ yarn install
- We can run yarn install multiple times safely, but we only need to do this once in the beginning.


## Project Development Workflow
- To run the server, use this command:
  - $ yarn start
- Then visit localhost:3000 in the browser.
- This will deploy the project in the web browser.
